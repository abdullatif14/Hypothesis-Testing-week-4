# Hypothesis-Testing-week-4

We have been tasked to investigate a research question based on a claim about electric car usage.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python; 


1.Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

2.Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.

3.Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
(This will need to be documented when writing the report). 

The dataset that we are going to use for this project is found in this link
